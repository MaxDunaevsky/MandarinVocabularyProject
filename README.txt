# MandarinVocabularyProject
... project for memorizing Mandarin vocabulary ...

Highly recommend using MandaringVocabularyProject with up-to-date version of 
Opera (http://www.opera.com) 
or 
Google Chrome (http://www.google.com/chrome/) 
browsers, which you could  download for free.

Any modern browser which supports HTML5 technologies will do, but some functionality may not work properly.

TIP
From time to time export your modified or created vocabularies to safe directory or external dirve (right arrow to the right of vocabulary button), so you have possibility to restore your vocabularies by import (right arrow to the left of vocabulary button) in case of some problems with browser or after clearing browser's local storage.

P.S. By the way, had learned just 300 basic hieroglyphs you could potentially understand something around 60% of common information in Chinese.And many of hieroglyphs are combination of others, which simplifies learning a bit ;)
